# 2D-Platformer-Game-Robo-Rescue

Repository for the STEM-based educational 2D platformer "Robo Rescue" game that was made by a team consisting of me and 5 classmates for our "Senior Project" course at Rowan University. The game is written in C# and was coded and built using VS Code and Unity Engine respectively.

***To run and play the game, download the Robo_Rescue.zip folder, extract the files from the zip folder, and double-click on the SeniorProject.exe executable file.***

HOW_TO_PLAY.txt file is currently WIP.
