# 2D-Platformer-Game-Robo-Rescue

Repository for the STEM-based 2D platformer game, titled "Robo Rescue", that was made by a team consisting of me (Gregory Zacharko) and 5 classmates (Monica Torres, Chairo Pela, Jennifer Menjivar, Aaron Youch, and Joseph Jose) for our "Senior Project" course at Rowan University. The game is written in C# and was coded and built using VS Code and the Unity game engine respectively.
