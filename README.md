# 2D-Platformer-Game-Robo-Rescue

Repository for the STEM-based 2D platformer game, titled "Robo Rescue", that was made by a team consisting of me (Gregory Zacharko) and 5 classmates (Monica Torres, Chairo Pela, Jennifer Menjivar, Aaron Youch, and Joseph Jose) for our "Senior Project" course at Rowan University. The game is written in C# and was coded and built using VS Code and the Unity game engine respectively.

***To download and play the game: download the "Robo_Rescue.zip" folder, extract the files from the zip folder, and double-click on the "SeniorProject.exe" executable file.***

**Controls: Use your mouse to navigate the menus. Use the "A" (move left), "S" (move right), and "D" (move down) keys to move and the "W" key to jump.**
