# 2D-Platformer-Game-Robo-Rescue

Repository for the STEM-based educational 2D platformer "Robo Rescue" game that was made by a team consisting of me and 5 classmates for our "Senior Project" course at Rowan University. The game is written in C# and was coded and built using VS Code and the Unity game engine respectively.

***To run and play the game, download the Robo_Rescue.zip folder, extract the files from the zip folder, and double-click on the SeniorProject.exe executable file.***

**Controls: Use your mouse to navigate the menus. Use the "A" (move left), "S" (move right), and "D" (move down) keys to move and the "W" key to jump.**
